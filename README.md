<h1 style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Old Me by 5SOS</h1>
<p>Shout out to the old me</p>
And everything he showed me</p>
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me</p>
No one could control me</p>
Left my lovers lonely</p>
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me</p>
Never a night alone</p>
Anywhere you wanna go</p>
Woke up in the morning wearing someone else's clothes</p>
Pictures in my phone</p>
With people I don't know</p>
Woke up in the morning how the hell'd I make it home</p>
And they wondered how long I could keep it up</p>
While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough</p>
And I did some shit I never should have done</p>
I would do it over now, I'd do it over</p>
Shout out to the old me</p>
And everything you showed me</p>
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me</p>
No one could control me</p>
Left my lovers lonely</p>
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me</p>
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made</p>
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid</p>
Shout out to the old me</p>
And everything he showed me</p>
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me</p>
Another round here we go</p>
Going in blow for blow</p>
Look into the mirror take the punches that I throw</p>
I'm constantly reminded of all the compromises</p>
By the people from my past who have a hard time letting go</p>
And they wondered how long I could keep it up</p>
While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough</p>
And I did some shit I never should have done</p>
I would do it over now, I'd do it over</p>
Shout out to the old me</p>
And everything you showed me</p>
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me</p>
No one could control me</p>
Left my lovers lonely</p>
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me</p>
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made</p>
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid</p>
Shout out to the old me</p>
And everything he showed me</p>
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me</p>
Devil at my door</p>
Got me knockin' knockin' knockin' on the other side</p>
Ashes on the floor</p>
But I'm walkin' walkin' walkin' outta here alive</p>
Shout out to the old me</p>
And everything you showed me</p>
Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me</p>
No one could control me</p>
Left my lovers lonely</p>
Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me</p>
All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made</p>
Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid</p>
Shout out to the old me</p>
And everything he showed me</p>
Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me</p>
