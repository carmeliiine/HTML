<h1 style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Old Me by 5SOS</h1>
<p>Shout out to the old me</p>
<p>And everything he showed me</p>
<p>Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me</p>
<p>No one could control me</p>
<p>Left my lovers lonely</p>
<p>Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me</p>
<p>Never a night alone</p>
<p>Anywhere you wanna go</p>
<p>Woke up in the morning wearing someone else's clothes</p>
<p>Pictures in my phone</p>
<p>With people I don't know</p>
<p>Woke up in the morning how the hell'd I make it home</p>
<p>And they wondered how long I could keep it up</p>
<p>While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough</p>
<p>And I did some shit I never should have done</p>
<p>I would do it over now, I'd do it over</p>
<p>Shout out to the old me</p>
<p>And everything you showed me</p>
<p>Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me</p>
<p>No one could control me</p>
<p>Left my lovers lonely</p>
<p>Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me</p>
<p>All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made</p>
<p>Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid</p>
<p>Shout out to the old me</p>
<p>And everything he showed me</p>
<p>Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me</p>
<p>Another round here we go</p>
<p>Going in blow for blow</p>
<p>Look into the mirror take the punches that I throw</p>
<p>I'm constantly reminded of all the compromises</p>
<p>By the people from my past who have a hard time letting go</p>
<p>And they wondered how long I could keep it up</p>
<p>While I wondered if I'd ever, if I'd ever get enough</p>
<p>And I did some shit I never should have done</p>
<p>I would do it over now, I'd do it over</p>
<p>Shout out to the old me</p>
<p>And everything you showed me</p>
<p>Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me</p>
<p>No one could control me</p>
<p>Left my lovers lonely</p>
<p>Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me</p>
<p>All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made</p>
<p>Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid</p>
<p>Shout out to the old me</p>
<p>And everything he showed me</p>
<p>Had to fuck it up before I let you get to know me</p>
<p>Devil at my door</p>
<p>Got me knockin' knockin' knockin' on the other side</p>
<p>Ashes on the floor</p>
<p>But I'm walkin' walkin' walkin' outta here alive</p>
<p>Shout out to the old me</p>
<p>And everything you showed me</p>
<p>Glad you didn't listen when the world was trying to slow me</p>
<p>No one could control me</p>
<p>Left my lovers lonely</p>
<p>Had to fuck it up before I really got to know me</p>
<p>All of the mistakes I made, I made, I made</p>
<p>Whatever the price I paid, I paid, I paid</p>
<p>Shout out to the old me</p>
